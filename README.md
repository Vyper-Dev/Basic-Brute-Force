# POC-Password-Cracker

This is a non-malicious proof of concept program I wrote, demonstrating how brute force password crackers work. It takes a user-given password and submits characters until the whole string is solved. In practice, this concept is much more difficult but aims to help people understand the importance of proper passwords.
